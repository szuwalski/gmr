# gmr
Plotting functions for GMACS

### Installation
To install the `gmr` package, the [`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) package is required.

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("szuwalski/gmr")
```

Now you can load the package and inspect the functions:

```
library(gmr)
plot_growth

```

Using the functions requires output from the General Model for Assessing Crustacean Stocks (GMACS), which is described in the GMACS repo.
